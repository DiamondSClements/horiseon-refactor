# horiseon-refactor
Refactoring existing code

## Description
The objective for this assignment was refactoring already existing code for a webpage and making it more accessible while keeping the same visual aspects the website had originally. 


## Getting Started

1. Downloaded starter code provided from class repository.
2. Created new folder to hold contents of starter code (index.html, css stylesheet, etc.).
3. Verified content in VS code.
4. Created new repository in GitHub for code.
5. Linked VS code and repository in GitHub.

## Executing
These are the corrections I made to the starter code that I felt improved the webpage's accessibility:

* Gave the webpage tab the title of "Horiseon". Originally, it just displayed "Webpage".
* Provided "alt" descriptions for all images.
* Used more suitable tag elements and css selectors.
* There were several css selectors that were listed seperately but had the exact same attributes. I combined those selectors to eliminate the repetitiveness of "WET" code. 

## Conclusion
With the revisions I made to the code, I was able to succesfully refactor the webpage with improved accessibility without altering the original appearance.
